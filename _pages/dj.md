## On the 1s and 2s
I taught myself how to DJ during the summer of 2024, but my mom always told me that I’ve wanted to be a DJ ever since I was little (lol). I love music and dancing and having a good time, so it only made sense when I bought a DJ controller off of Facebook marketplace. I most enjoy listening to and mixing jersey club, baile funk, and miami bass. My debut was during one of my best friends’ birthday–a small gig in my apartment living room where I played a personalized set (not to mention, it has 36 plays on Soundcloud). DJing has been unexpectedly challenging, but I love continuously learning new skills and techniques and perfecting my craft.
