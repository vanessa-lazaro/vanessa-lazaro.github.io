<font size="5"> <b> What is the primary mechanism underlying the development of social prototypes (i.e., mental representations of people)? </b></font>
<em>In collaboration with Dr. Lin Bian </em>

In the U.S, White people are seen as more prototypical–or more representative–of “people” than people of color (1). Lay beliefs about who is more representative of people have serious, real-world consequences related to stereotyping and prejudice. Importantly, these beliefs about representativeness emerge in early childhood (2-4). In this work, we examine potential mechanisms that might underlie the development of social prototypicality. In other words, what social cognitive factors drive how we think about who is representative of “people”? 


<font size="5"> <b> Do children prefer brilliant peers depending on their gender and race? </b> </font>
<em>In collaboration with Dr. Lin Bian </em>

Women’s underrepresentation in academic fields and professions emphasizing high intellectual talents (5-6) persists as a prominent societal issue. To explore early antecedents of this gender imbalance, this project investigated children’s social preference for brilliant, or intellectually gifted, peers. We find that as early as elementary school years, children’s social preference in contexts valuing brilliance becomes both gendered and racialized as children get older. Our findings highlight the importance of using an intersectional approach to identify the processes that contribute to social disparities in brilliance-required contexts. This project was published in <em> Developmental Psychology </em>–read more about our findings [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39172420/)!


<font size="5">  <b>   How do children’s sense of belonging influence their motivation to engage in contexts that emphasize brilliance? How can we boost belongingness to increase children's motivation?</b> </font>
<em>In collaboration with Drs. Lin Bian and Rongzhi Liu </em>

As early as 6-years-old, girls show lower interest than boys in activities that require exceptional intellectual ability (7), suggesting that the gender disparity in fields that highlight brilliance may begin to develop in early childhood.  In this project, we examine how children’s sense of belonging may impact their motivation to engage in activities that emphasize brilliance. Additionally, we investigate if and how boosting children’s sense of belonging can potentially increase motivation.
