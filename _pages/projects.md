What is the primary mechanism underlying the development of social prototypes, or mental representations of people?  
In collaboration with Dr. Lin Bian  

In the U.S, White people are seen as more prototypical–or more representative–of “people” than people of color (1). Lay beliefs about who is more representative of people have serious, real-world consequences related to stereotyping and prejudice. Importantly, these beliefs about representativeness emerge in early childhood (2-5). In this work, we examine potential mechanisms that might underlie the development of social prototypicality. In other words, what social cognitive factors drive how we think about who is representative of “people”?
