## On the PS5
I’ve been playing video games ever since I was 5 years old and my older brothers taught me how to play Counterstrike on the PC. Ever since then, I’ve grown up playing on different consoles from the Sega Genesis and Gamecube to the Nintendo DS, Wii, and Playstation. I love how immersed you can be in a video game and being able to feel a range of emotions like comfort and triumph, but also disappointment and grief. I keep a notes app of all the video games I have played (60+ and counting), but some of my all-time favorites include the RDR 2, Witcher III, and Guitar Hero III.
Currently playing: Outer Worlds
