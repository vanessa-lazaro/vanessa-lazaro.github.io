I am a 5th-year PhD candidate as well as an Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research fellow at the University of Chicago broadly studying social cognitive development. Specifically, [my research](https://vanessa-lazaro.github.io/projects/) focuses on how children think about intersecting social categories in the context of social inequality. I answer questions like how children’s social beliefs develop, who children think of as brilliant (i.e., intellectually gifted), and how these beliefs influence behavior. Previous to the University of Chicago, I graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Sociology and certificate in Inequality Studies.
