I am a 5th-year PhD candidate as well as an Institute of Education Sciences (IES) and National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research fellow at the University of Chicago broadly studying how young children think about their social world. Specifically, [my research](https://vanessa-lazaro.github.io/projects/) focuses on how children think about intersecting social categories (e.g. race and gender) in the context of social inequality. I answer questions like how children’s intersectional social beliefs emerge, who children think of as brilliant (i.e., intellectually gifted) and how their beliefs influence behavior, as well as how to rectify social disparities in contexts that emphasize brilliance. Previous to the University of Chicago, I graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Sociology and certificate in Inequality Studies.
