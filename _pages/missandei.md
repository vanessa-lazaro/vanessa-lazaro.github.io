## Spending time with my dog
I love spending time with Missandei, our 5.5-year-old (lab? doberman? hound?) puppy. We rescued her when she was just a few months old while I still lived in Arizona. Upon my decision to go to graduate school and move to a city that I've never been to, Missandei decided to tag along as well--so we took a ~30-hour road trip from Phoenix to Chicago. Although she absolutely hated that drive, Missandei now calls the midwest her home. She enjoys hunting squirrels, people-watching, and eating whatever she finds appetizing (once being my leftover sushi...). At this point, Missandei deserves a PhD too.
